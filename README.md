## About Bump Absorber

Bump Absorber is a plugin for [MyBB](https://mybb.com/) 1.8. It inhibits thread bumps (by new posts) in stipulated forums: only replies by the thread's author bump the thread, and only after the expiry of a stipulated bump interval (since the last bumping post, counting the first post as a bumping post). Replies by other members never bump threads in the stipulated forums.

## About Bump Absorber

Bump Absorber is a plugin for [MyBB](https://mybb.com/) 1.8 which was written for a fee for a MyBB admin - [@andrewjs18](https://github.com/andrewjs18) who asked that it then be open sourced. It provides two features:

1. In stipulated forums: the inhibiting of thread bumps (by a new post) other than the original poster after a stipulated period in hours has elapsed.

2. In separately stipulated forums: the ability of the original poster to close/open their thread, without needing to be a moderator/admin.
